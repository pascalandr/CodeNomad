# AGENT NOTES

## Styling Guidelines
- Reuse the existing token & utility layers before introducing new CSS variables or custom properties. Extend `src/styles/tokens.css` / `src/styles/utilities.css` if a shared pattern is needed.
- Keep aggregate entry files (e.g., `src/styles/controls.css`, `messaging.css`, `panels.css`) lean—they should only `@import` feature-specific subfiles located inside `src/styles/{components|messaging|panels}`.
- When adding new component styles, place them beside their peers in the scoped subdirectory (e.g., `src/styles/messaging/new-part.css`) and import them from the corresponding aggregator file.
- Prefer smaller, focused style files (≈150 lines or less) over large monoliths. Split by component or feature area if a file grows beyond that size.
- Co-locate reusable UI patterns (buttons, selectors, dropdowns, etc.) under `src/styles/components/` and avoid redefining the same utility classes elsewhere.
- Use the shared `.window-*` primitives from `src/styles/components/window.css` for dialog, popover, and floating-window headers, toolbars, bodies, footers, titles, and actions.
- Keep agent, model, and thinking controls in the composer footer via `PromptContextControls`; adapt that footer with the named `prompt-composer` container rather than viewport-only breakpoints.
- Session rows keep actions inline until their measured title, badges, and controls no longer fit. Keep responsive action styles in `styles/components/session-row-actions.css`; hidden inline controls remain measurable but inert, and an open overflow menu stays mounted until dismissal.
- Session hierarchy geometry lives in `styles/components/session-tree.css`; connector axes follow the parent expander at every depth, including selection mode, RTL and touch layouts.
- Session search/filter mode uses flat per-session results with an optional subsession switch; filters, sorting, worktree badges and selection use each result's own identity. Normal browsing retains the session hierarchy.
- Never use rounded corners in UI styling; keep corners square unless the user explicitly requests otherwise for a specific change.
- Explicit round exceptions: Yolo and MCP switches (shared `styles/components/switches.css` geometry), overlay drawer navigation buttons, and floating message scroll buttons. Other chrome remains square.
- Tags and numeric/context/token labels also use rounded geometry via `--chip-radius` (`--pill-radius` is an alias). Register badge variants in `styles/components/badges.css`; use `.badge-shape` for utility-styled labels rather than adding a local radius.
- The message-content popup and Chat settings share `components/transcript-visibility.ts`; tool presentation metadata lives independently of renderers in `components/tool-call/tool-presentation.ts`. Popup styles live in `styles/components/transcript-filters.css`.
- Session timeline placement spans the transcript and composer via the session-owned mount; keep its rail layout in `styles/messaging/session-timeline-rail.css` and preserve compact-layout hiding.
- Document any new styling conventions or directory additions in this file so future changes remain consistent.
- Soft palette families live in `packages/ui/src/lib/soft-color-schemes.ts`, with references in `dev-docs/PALETTE_SOURCES.md`. Keep selection independent of participant identity, and keep transcript/composer surfaces distinct. Run `palette-quality.test.ts` and inspect real rendered captures when changing palette colors or their token mapping.
- Palette settings follow the resolved appearance in Auto mode. Keep the picker, single-row square swatches and trailing actions aligned. Swatch names use tooltips and accessible input labels. At narrow card widths, scroll the swatch strip beside the picker and move actions below via the `palette-settings` container. Swatch styles live in `styles/components/theme-scheme-swatches.css`.
- Appearance mode and the saved light/dark selections are independent (`lib/appearance-preferences.ts`). Message/tool cards use the muted surface, inset output and the composer use the base canvas, and preferences use the same secondary surface as the main panels. Use `--surface-hover-overlay` for a subtle local rollover; preserve selected backgrounds beneath that overlay instead of replacing them with a generic panel color.
- Right-panel base-canvas button rollover overrides live in `styles/panels/control-hover.css`; do not substitute the secondary surface merely to show hover.
- Project and right-panel tabs share `components/tab-scroll.tsx` and `styles/components/tab-scroll.css`. Keep their native scrollbar above upright content without mirrored transforms, negative border overlaps or permanent compositing hints. Validate shared scrollbar styling and adjoining edges at fractional zoom in the browser and isolated Electron renderer fixtures (`tests/browser/tab-chrome.test.ts`).

## Coding Principles

- Worktree discovery/create/remove use `workspaces/native-worktrees.ts` and the native OpenCode worktree API. CodeNomad supplies the `.codenomad/worktrees` default, named-branch policy and verified family transactions. Git common-directory identity scopes the native inventory to the opened local repository; opaque worktree identifiers are separate from mutable branch labels. Validate through `scripts/test-opencode-location-native.mjs` with an isolated CLI and `tests/browser/worktrees.test.ts` for selector gestures.

- Session pruning is a narrow V2 plugin/RPC exception under `packages/server/src/opencode/session-pruning/`; see `dev-docs/SESSION_PRUNING_RPC.md`. Bundle it with the shared server for both desktop hosts and provision through normal native plugin discovery. RPC registrations follow backend presence; clean shutdown removes that backend's lease and crashes expire. Loading never deletes content. Deletion occurs only on an explicit pruning request, without an extra enable-write switch or beta-number gate. Keep generic RPC proxy access closed. Writes validate actual storage, a fresh daemon-storage identity challenge and the native durable execution claim inside a synchronous SQLite transaction. Run isolated native concurrency/payload and client-cache regressions; tests must never target the shared daemon or a user's database.
- Favor KISS by keeping modules narrowly scoped and limiting public APIs to what callers actually need.
- Uphold DRY: share helpers via dedicated modules before copy/pasting logic across stores, components, or scripts.
- Enforce single responsibility; split large files when concerns diverge (state, actions, API, events, etc.).
- Prefer composable primitives (signals, hooks, utilities) over deep inheritance or implicit global state.
- When adding platform integrations (SSE, IPC, SDK), isolate them in thin adapters that surface typed events/actions.

## Multi-Language Support (i18n)

The UI uses a small custom i18n layer (no ICU/messageformat). When building features, never hardcode user-visible strings.

- **Runtime API:** use `useI18n()` in components (`const { t } = useI18n();`) and `tGlobal(...)` in stores/non-component code.
  - Implementation: `packages/ui/src/lib/i18n/index.tsx`
- **Where messages live:** `packages/ui/src/lib/i18n/messages/<locale>/` as TypeScript objects (`"flat.dot.keys": "string"`).
  - Each locale has an `index.ts` that merges message parts; duplicate keys throw at build time.
  - Merge helper: `packages/ui/src/lib/i18n/messages/merge.ts`
- **Adding a new string:** add it to the appropriate `.../messages/en/*.ts` part file, then add the same key to each other locale’s corresponding file.
  - Missing translations fall back to English (and finally to the key), so gaps can be easy to miss.
- **Interpolation:** placeholders are simple `{name}` replacements (word characters only). Avoid placeholders like `{file-name}`.
- **Pluralization:** handle manually via separate keys like `something.one` / `something.other` and choose in code.
- **Adding a new language:** add a new `messages/<locale>/` folder + `index.ts`, register it in `packages/ui/src/lib/i18n/index.tsx`, and add it to the language picker in `packages/ui/src/components/folder-selection-view.tsx`.
- **Locale persistence:** the selected locale is stored in app preferences (`locale`) and persisted via the server config (default `~/.config/codenomad/config.yaml`; `config.json` is migration input only).
- **Avoid English-only paths:** do not import `enMessages` directly in feature code; always go through `t(...)` so locale changes apply.

## File Length Guidelines (Highlight Only)

We track file size as a refactoring signal. When you touch or create files, highlight oversized files so the team can plan refactors when time permits.

- Source files: warn after ~500 lines; target limit ~800 lines
- Test files: highlight after ~1000 lines

Behavior for agents:
- Do not refactor solely to satisfy these thresholds.
- When a change touches a file that exceeds the warning/limit, mention it in your final response and include the file path and approximate line count.
- When creating new files, aim to stay under the thresholds unless there's a clear reason.

## Tooling Preferences
- Use the `edit` tool for modifying existing files; prefer it over other editing methods.
- Use the `write` tool only when creating new files from scratch.
- Browser rendering regressions live in `packages/ui/tests/browser/`, with deterministic HTTP fixtures beside them in `fixtures/`. Exercise the real Solid components and native event dispatcher rather than reimplementing rendering logic.
- Transcript rows retain pointer hit testing during virtualizer scrolling (`styles/messaging/virtual-follow-list.css`), so nested code/tool scrollers and message controls receive gestures at their visible target.
- Run them with `npm run test:browser --workspace @codenomad/ui` after `npx playwright install chromium`. `CODENOMAD_BROWSER_PATH` optionally selects an existing Chromium executable; it does not target the installed application or user sessions.

## V2 Runtime Launch
- Enable **Developer Mode** from the session tab bar and fully restart CodeNomad once; do not configure a fixed CDP port or a manual WebView2 profile.
- Rebuild Electron before calling `codenomad.act({ action: "restart" })`. For Windows Tauri, stop and relaunch the release executable only when the linker cannot replace it; never stop the shared OpenCode daemon.

## Commit Message Guidelines
- When creating commits, use detailed commit messages: a concise conventional-style subject followed by body paragraphs that explain the user-visible behavior change, the implementation approach, important edge cases or platform considerations, and the validation or test coverage added.
- Prefer messages that explain why the change exists and how regressions are prevented, not just a list of touched files.
